## Key Features
### 1. Accepts Any JSON, JSONB, and CSV Data
RushDB allows developers to push raw JSON or CSV data without worrying about schema definitions. RushDB **automatically normalizes data** and structures it as a graph, making queries fast and intuitive.

#### Create Record

```sdk
from rushdb import RushDB

db = RushDB("API_TOKEN")

data = {
    "name": "Google LLC",
    "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA",
    "foundedAt": "1998-09-04T00:00:00.000Z",
    "rating": 4.9
}

record = db.records.create("COMPANY", data)
___SPLIT___
const db = new RushDB('API_TOKEN');

const data = {
    name: 'Google LLC',
    address: '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA',
    foundedAt: '1998-09-04T00:00:00.000Z',
    rating: 4.9
}

const record = await db.records.create("COMPANY", data)
```

#### Query Records

```sdk
query = {
    "labels": ["COMPANY"],
    "where": {
        "name": {"$contains": "Goog"},
        "rating": {"$gte": 4}
    }
}

records = db.records.find(query)
___SPLIT___
const records = await db.records.find({
    labels: ['COMPANY'],
    where: {
        name: { $contains: 'Goog' },
        rating: { $gte : 4 }
    }
})
```

### 2. Automatic Data Normalization and Type Inference
RushDB takes raw input data and **automatically structures it** into a connected graph, allowing for seamless navigation across relationships.

#### Example JSON data

```json
/* ORDER */
{
  "total": 109.98,                           <-- PROPERTY total:`number`
  "status": "processing",                    <-- PROPERTY status:`string`
  "placedAt": "2025-02-15T09:35:26+00:00",   <-- PROPERTY placedAt:`datatime`
  "SHIPPING": {                              <-- RECORD :SHIPPING
    "address": "123 Main St, City, Country", <-- PROPERTY address:`string`
    "method": "express",                     <-- PROPERTY method:`string`
    "cost": 9.99                             <-- PROPERTY cost:`number`
  }
}
```

Above payload will be automatically normalized into separate **flat** Records. And relationship between ORDER and SHIPPING will be created automatically.

### 3. Relationships
RushDB automatically creates relationships between Records based on JSON input, which is normalized into separate flat Records.

However, relationship creation isn't limited to data loading. You can also establish relationships between existing Records, providing a powerful tool to add more meaning to your data.

Managing Relationships:

```sdk
project = db.records.create(
    "PROJECT", {"name": "Secret Project", "budget": 1000000}
)

employee = db.records.create(
    "EMPLOYEE", {"name": "Nikola Tesla"}
)

options = RelationshipOptions(type="HAS_EMPLOYEE")

# create Relationship
project.attach(employee, options)

# delete Relationship
project.detach(employee)
___SPLIT___
const project = await db.records.create('PROJECT', {
    name: 'Secret Project',
    budget: 1000000
})

const employee = await db.records.create('EMPLOYEE', {
    name: 'Nikola Tesla'
})

// create Relationship
await project.attach(employee, { type: 'HAS_EMPLOYEE' })

// delete Relationship
await project.detach(employee)
```

### 4. Query Smarter, Not Harder
Effortlessly find exactly what you need. With automated, on-the-fly data normalization, you can query complex, deeply interconnected data without workarounds or unnecessary overhead - just clear, intuitive access to your data.
#### Examples

```sdk
db.records.find(
    {
        "labels": ["COMPANY"],
        "where": {
            "stage": "seed",
            "address": {"$contains": "USA"},
            "foundedAt": {"$lte": {"$year": 2000}},
            "rating": {
                "$or": [{"$lt": 2.5}, {"$gte": 4.5}]
            },
            "EMPLOYEE": {
                "$relation": {"type": "HIRED", "direction": "out"},
                "$alias": "$employee",
                "salary": {
                    "$gte": 500_000
                }
            },
        },
        "aggregate": {
            "employees": {
                "fn": "collect",
                "alias": "$employee",
                "limit": 10
            }
        },
        "skip": 0,
        "limit": 100
    }
)
___SPLIT___
await db.records.find({
  labels: ['COMPANY'],
  where: {
    stage: 'seed',
    address: { $contains: 'USA' },
    foundedAt: {
      $lte: { $year: 2000 }
    },
    rating: {
      $or: [{ $lt: 2.5 }, { $gte: 4.5 }]
    },
    EMPLOYEE: {
      $relation: { type: 'HIRED', direction: 'out' },
      $alias: '$employee',
      salary: {
        $gte: 500_000
      }
    }
  },
  aggregate: {
    employees: {
      fn: 'collect',
      alias: '$employee',
      limit: 10
    }
  },
  skip: 0,
  limit: 100
})
```

Under the hood, RushDB transforms this into an optimized and powerful Cypher query. The query engine allows developers to think about data naturally, the way we intuitively use and perceive it, while RushDB handles the complexity behind the scenes:

```cypher
MATCH (record:__RUSHDB__LABEL__RECORD__:COMPANY { __RUSHDB__KEY__PROJECT__ID__: $projectId })

WHERE (any(value IN record.stage WHERE value = "seed"))
AND (any(value IN record.address WHERE value =~ "(?i).*USA.*"))
AND (any(value IN record.foundedAt WHERE apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(`record`.`__RUSHDB__KEY__PROPERTIES__META__`).`foundedAt` = "datetime" AND datetime(value) <= datetime({year: 2000})))
AND ((any(value IN record.rating WHERE value < 2.5) OR any(value IN record.rating WHERE value >= 4.5)))

ORDER BY record.`__RUSHDB__KEY__ID__`
DESC SKIP 0 LIMIT 100

OPTIONAL MATCH (record)-[:HIRED]->(record1:EMPLOYEE) WHERE (any(value IN record1.salary WHERE value >= 500000))
WITH record, record1
WHERE record IS NOT NULL AND record1 IS NOT NULL

WITH record,
apoc.coll.sortMaps(collect(DISTINCT record1 {
    .*, __RUSHDB__KEY__LABEL__: [label IN labels(record1) WHERE label <> "__RUSHDB__LABEL__RECORD__"][0]
}), "__RUSHDB__KEY__ID__")[0..10] AS `employees`

RETURN collect(DISTINCT record {
    __RUSHDB__KEY__ID__: record.__RUSHDB__KEY__ID__,
    __RUSHDB__KEY__PROPERTIES__META__: record.__RUSHDB__KEY__PROPERTIES__META__,
    __RUSHDB__KEY__LABEL__: [label IN labels(record) WHERE label <> "__RUSHDB__LABEL__RECORD__"][0],
    `employees`
}) AS records
```

### 5. Transactions
RushDB is fully ACID-compliant, providing robust tools to ensure data consistency and reliability. With the Transactions API, you can execute multiple operations confidently - either every request completes successfully, or all changes are rolled back, maintaining data integrity.

Working with transactions in RushDB is seamless:

```sdk
tx = db.transactions.begin()

try:
    # Create some Records
    item = db.records.create(
        "ITEM",
        {"title": "Nike Air Max 270", "price": 150},
        transaction=tx,
    )

    owner = db.records.create(
        "OWNER",
        {"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "janesmith@example.com"},
        transaction=tx
    )

    options = RelationshipOptions(type="OWN", direction="out")

    # create Relationship
    owner.attach(item, options, transaction=tx)

    # Simulate an error
    raise ValueError("Simulated error")

    # Commit the Transaction if all operations succeed
    tx.commit();

except ValueError:
    #  If any records or relationships creation failed, roll back the entire operation
    transaction.rollback()
___SPLIT___
const tx = await db.tx.begin();

try {
  // Create some Records
  const item = await db.records.create('ITEM', {
    title: 'Nike Air Max 270',
    price: 150
  }, tx);

  const owner = await db.records.create('OWNER', {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    email: 'janesmith@example.com',
  }, tx);

  // create Relationship
  await owner.attach(item, {
    type: 'OWN',
    direction: 'out',
  }, tx);

  // Simulate an error
  throw new Error('Simulated error')

  // Commit the Transaction if all operations succeed
  await tx.commit();
} catch (e) {
  // If any Records or Relationships creation failed, roll back the entire operation
  await tx.rollback();
}
```

### 6. Properties: Lightweight Connectors That Unify Your Data

Minimal data overhead, maximum impact—RushDB’s **Properties** system enables developers to build best-in-class search experiences while unlocking deeper insights from their data.

Properties act as intelligent containers that links Records, connecting fields with the same name and type across different data entities. For example, if multiple Records - regardless of Label - share a `color` property with the value `red`, RushDB will automatically surface all relevant Records. It’s like querying across multiple SQL tables by a common field and value, but without the complexity.

This makes **Properties** a powerful tool for data discovery, search, and seamless cross-entity relationships.

#### Example

```sdk
query = {
    "where": {
        "color": "red"
    }
}

records = db.records.find(query)
___SPLIT___
const records = await db.records.find({
    where: {
        color: 'red'
    }
})
```

Moreover, with the Properties API, building advanced search experiences is straightforward. Developers can seamlessly query related Records across different entities without complex joins or manual indexing. Whether you're implementing faceted search, dynamic filtering, or personalized recommendations, RushDB ensures your data remains connected and instantly accessible.

```sdk
# Property `name` [string]
db.properties.values(
  "0192397b-8579-7ce2-a899-01c59bad63f8"
)
# Response
{
  "values": [
    "Eleanor Whitaker",
    "Marcus Donovan",
    "Priya Kapoor",
    "Julian Alvarez"
  ],
  "type": "string"
}

# Property \`size\` [number]
db.properties.values(
  "019412c0-2051-71fe-bc9d-26117b52c119"
)
# Response
{
  "min": 5.5,
  "max": 12.5,
  "values": [5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, ...],
  "type": "number"
}
___SPLIT___
// Property `name` [string]
await db.properties.values(
  '0192397b-8579-7ce2-a899-01c59bad63f8'
)
// Response
{
  values: [
    'Eleanor Whitaker',
    'Marcus Donovan',
    'Priya Kapoor',
    'Julian Alvarez'
  ],
  type: 'string'
}

// Property \`size\` [number]
await db.properties.values(
  '019412c0-2051-71fe-bc9d-26117b52c119'
)
// Response
{
  min: 5.5,
  max: 12.5,
  values: [5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, ...],
  type: 'number'
}
```

### **7. A Universal API for the Entire Platform**

RushDB is built with a **query-centric** design, ensuring that most endpoints follow a consistent request format. This unified approach enhances developer experience by minimizing the learning curve - master one request structure, and you can apply it across the entire platform.

At the core of RushDB are three key entities: **Record, Property, and Label**. All of them can be queried using the same **SearchQuery**, eliminating the need for backend data gymnastics. This means you can focus on building products without worrying about complex data handling - just query once and get exactly what you need, every time.

```sdk
# Same DTO to rule them all
query = {
    "where": {
        "$or": [{"stage": "seed"}, {stage: "roundA"}],
        "EMPLOYEE": {
                "salary": {
                "$gte": 500_000
            }
        }
    }
}

# Find Labels of Records that match the criteria
labels = db.labels.find(query)

# Find Records that match the criteria
records = db.properties.find(query)

# Find Properties of Records that match the criteria
properties = db.labels.find(query)
___SPLIT___
// Same DTO to rule them all
const query = {
  where: {
    $or: [{ stage: 'seed' }, { stage: 'roundA' }],
    EMPLOYEE: {
      salary: {
        $gte: 500_000
      }
    }
  }
}

// Find Labels of Records that match the criteria
const labels = await db.labels.find(query)

// Find Records that match the criteria
const records = await db.records.find(query)

// Find Properties of Records that match the criteria
const properties = await db.properties.find(query)
```
