# Introducing RushDB: Zero-Config Instant Database for Modern Apps & the AI Era

RushDB is an instant database for modern apps and DS/ML ops built on top of Neo4j.

In a world where developers demand speed, simplicity, and efficiency, **RushDB** emerges as a **zero-config, instant database** built for modern applications and the AI-driven era. With **automatic data normalization, ACID compliance, and native graph capabilities**, RushDB offers a powerful, developer-friendly solution for handling structured and semi-structured data effortlessly.

## Why RushDB?
Traditional databases require extensive setup, schema definitions, and manual optimization. RushDB eliminates these barriers with:

- **Zero Configuration** – Just push any JSON or CSV; RushDB takes care of the rest.
- **Graph-Powered Storage** – Automatically structures relationships between data.
- **ACID Transactions** – Ensures consistency and reliability.
- **Powerful Queries with Simple SDKs** – NoSQL flexibility with SQL-like expressiveness.
- **Self-Hosted or Cloud** – Deploy anywhere with ease.

## Key Features
### 1. Push Any JSON or CSV Data
RushDB allows developers to push raw JSON or CSV data without worrying about schema definitions. RushDB **automatically normalizes data** and structures it as a graph, making queries fast and intuitive.

#### Create Record

Python:
```python
from rushdb import RushDB

db = RushDB("API_TOKEN")

data = {
    "name": "Google LLC",
    "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA",
    "foundedAt": "1998-09-04T00:00:00.000Z",
    "rating": 4.9
}

record = db.records.create("COMPANY", data)
```

Typescript / Javascript:
```typescript
import RushDB from "@rushdb/javascript-sdk"

const db = new RushDB("API_TOKEN");

const data = {
    name: "Google LLC",
    address: "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA",
    foundedAt: "1998-09-04T00:00:00.000Z",
    rating: 4.9
}

const record = await db.records.create("COMPANY", data)
```

#### Query Records

Python:
```python
query = {
    "labels": ["COMPANY"],
    "where": {
        "name": {"$contains": "Goog"},
        "rating": {"$gte": 4}
    }
}

records = db.records.find(query)
```

Typescript / Javascript:
```typescript
const records = await db.records.find({
    labels: ['COMPANY'],
    where: {
        name: { $contains: "Goog" },
        rating: { $gte : 4 }
    }
})
```

### 2. Automatic Data Normalization and Type Inference
RushDB takes raw input data and **automatically structures it** into a connected graph, allowing for seamless navigation across relationships.

#### Example

```json
/* ORDER */
{
  "total": 109.98,
  "status": "processing",
  "SHIPPING": {
    "address": "123 Main St, City, Country",
    "method": "express",
    "cost": 9.99
  },
  "ITEMS": [
    {
      "productId": "abc123",
      "name": "Wireless Mouse",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 29.99
    },
    {
      "productId": "xyz789",
      "name": "Mechanical Keyboard",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 79.99
    }
  ]
}
```

Above payload will be automatically normalized into separate **flat** Records:

ORDER:
```js
{
  total: "number",
  status: "string"
}
```

ITEMS:
```js
{
  productId: "string",
  name: "string",
  quantity: "number",
  price: "number"
}
```

SHIPPING:
```js
{
  address: "string",
  method: "string",
  cost: "number"
}
```

### 3. Relationships
RushDB automatically creates relationships between Records according to input.

```sql
ORDER -> ITEMS * 2
ORDER -> SHIPPING
```

Creating relationships to give even more sense to data manually is also easy and smooth:

Python:
```python
project = db.records.create(
    "PROJECT", {"name": "Secret Project", "budget": 1000000}
)

employee = db.records.create(
    "EMPLOYEE", {"name": "Nikola Tesla"}
)

options = RelationshipOptions(type="HAS_EMPLOYEE")

project.attach(employee, options)
```

Typescript:
```typescript
const project = await db.records.create("PROJECT", {
    name: "Secret Project",
    budget: 1000000
})

const employee = await db.records.create("EMPLOYEE", {
    name: "Nikola Tesla"
})

await project.attach(employee, { type: "HAS_EMPLOYEE" })
```


### 4. Query Smarter, Not Harder
Find exactly what you need with ease. With automated on-the-fly data normalization, query complex, deeply interconnected data without the acrobatics.

#### Examples

Python:
```python
db.records.find(
    {
        "labels": ["COMPANY"],
        "where": {
            "stage": "seed",
            "address": {"$contains": "USA"},
            "foundedAt": {"$year": {"$lte": 2000}},
            "rating": {
                "$or": [{"$lt": 2.5}, {"$gte": 4.5}]
            },
            "EMPLOYEE": {
                "$alias": "$employee",
                "salary": {
                    "$gte": 500_000
                }
            },
        },
        "aggregate": {
            "employees": {
                "fn": "collect",
                "alias": "$employee",
                "limit": 10
            }
        },
    }
)
```
Typescript:
```typescript
await db.records.find({
  labels: ['COMPANY'],
  where: {
    stage: 'seed',
    address: { $contains: 'USA' },
    foundedAt: {
      $year: { $lte: 2000 }
    },
    rating: {
      $or: [{ $lt: 2.5 }, { $gte: 4.5 }]
    },
    EMPLOYEE: {
      $alias: '$employee',
      salary: {
        $gte: 500_000
      }
    }
  },
  aggregate: {
    employees: {
      fn: 'collect',
      alias: '$employee',
      limit: 10
    }
  }
})
```
