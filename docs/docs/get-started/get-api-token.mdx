# Get API Token

To use RushDB, you'll need an API token for authentication. Here's how to get one:

## 1. Create an Account

Visit [RushDB Dashboard](https://dashboard.rushdb.com) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.

## 2. Create a Project

1. After signing in, click on "New Project"
2. Enter a name for your project
3. Choose your preferred region
4. Click "Create"

## 3. Generate API Token

1. In your project dashboard, navigate to the "API Tokens" section
2. Click "Generate New Token"
3. Give your token a name (e.g., "Development", "Production")
4. Choose the appropriate permissions:
   - `read` - Read access to records and relationships
   - `write` - Create and update records and relationships
   - `delete` - Delete records and relationships
   - `admin` - Full access, including managing project settings
5. Click "Generate Token"

## 4. Copy and Store Your Token

Your API token will be displayed only once. Make sure to:

1. Copy the token immediately
2. Store it securely
3. Never commit it to version control
4. Use environment variables or secure configuration management

Example of using environment variables:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default>
```typescript
// Load from environment variable
const db = new RushDB({
  apiToken: process.env.RUSHDB_API_TOKEN
});
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```python
import os

db = RushDB(api_token=os.environ['RUSHDB_API_TOKEN'])
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rest" label="REST API">
```bash
# Set in your shell
export RUSHDB_API_TOKEN='your-api-token'

# Use in requests
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUSHDB_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.rushdb.com/v1/records
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Token Security

- Keep your tokens secure and private
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Use different tokens for development and production
- Limit token permissions to only what's needed
- Monitor token usage in the dashboard
- Revoke tokens immediately if compromised
