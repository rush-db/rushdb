Here are some concrete prompts you can use with your MCP client to interact with RushDB.

## Listing labels

> Ask the RushDB MCP server to run `FindLabels` with `limit=20`.

## Creating and querying records

> Use `CreateRecord` to add a `Task` with data `{"title": "Write docs", "status": "open"}`.

> Now use `FindRecords` with `where={"status": "open"}` and `orderBy={"createdAt": "desc"}` limit 5.

## Setting records

> Use `SetRecord` for `recordId="<id>"` with label `Task` and data `{"title": "Polish docs", "status": "in-progress"}`.

## Attaching relationships

> Call `AttachRelation` from `sourceId="<sourceId>"` to `targetIds=["<target1>", "<target2>"]` with `relationType="references"`.

## Transactions

> Start a transaction, create two `Task` records, attach a relation, and commit.

If something goes wrong, you can ask your client to call `TransactionRollback` with the `transactionId` returned from `TransactionBegin`.
