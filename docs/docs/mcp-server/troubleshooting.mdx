Common issues and how to fix them.

## Missing API key

Error:

```
RUSHDB_API_KEY environment variable is required. Set it in a .env file (packages/mcp-server/.env) or export it before running the server.
```

Fix:
- Provide `RUSHDB_API_KEY` in your MCP client config under `env`, or
- Create a `.env` file with `RUSHDB_API_KEY=...`, or
- `export RUSHDB_API_KEY=...` in your shell

## Wrong or unreachable API URL

Errors like:
- `Invalid URL`
- `Failed to fetch`
- `Network error`

Fix:
- Verify `RUSHDB_API_URL` (if set) points to a valid RushDB API endpoint.
- If youâ€™re self-hosting, make sure your server is reachable from your machine.
- Remove `RUSHDB_API_URL` to use the default `https://api.rushdb.com/api/v1`.

## "RushDB is not a constructor"

Cause:
- Some environments/bundlers differ in how CJS/ESM default exports are exposed, causing the constructor to be missing.

Fix:
- The MCP server now resolves the constructor from `default`, `RushDB`, or the module itself, so updating to the latest version should address this.
- If building from source, rebuild the package and restart your MCP client.

## Permissions or timeouts

- Check your network/firewall configuration.
- Increase client timeouts if your environment is slow.
- Try smaller `limit` values on large queries.
