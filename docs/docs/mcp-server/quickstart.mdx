Get up and running with the RushDB MCP server in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A RushDB account and API key from https://rushdb.com (Dashboard: https://app.rushdb.com)
- An MCP client (for example, Claude Desktop)
- Node.js 18+ installed locally

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @rushdb/mcp-server
```

Alternatively, you can run the server with `npx` from your MCP client configuration.

## Configure your MCP client (Claude Desktop example)

Add or update your Claude Desktop config (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rushdb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@rushdb/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "RUSHDB_API_KEY": "your-rushdb-api-key-here",
        "RUSHDB_API_URL": "https://api.rushdb.com/api/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `RUSHDB_API_KEY` is required.
- `RUSHDB_API_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://api.rushdb.com/api/v1`. Override it for self-hosted/staging.

## Verify

Restart your MCP client. Ask it something like:

> Use the RushDB MCP server to list labels.

You should see a tool call response listing labels, or a helpful message if your credentials are missing.

## Enable the Query Builder prompt (recommended)

To make discovery-first behavior automatic, your MCP client should:

1) Call `ListPrompts` â†’ find `rushdb.queryBuilder`.
2) Call `GetPrompt` with that name.
3) Set the returned system message for the model session that will use RushDB tools.

Once enabled, the agent will first discover labels/properties and then construct validated SearchQuery objects for find-related calls.

No Prompts support? Use the fallback tool:

> Call `GetQueryBuilderPrompt` and set the response as the system message for your RushDB session.
