# Where

The `where` clause in SearchQuery is a powerful mechanism to filter records based on property values and relationships. It's one of the key elements that make RushDB queries flexible and expressive.

#### Where Placement in SearchQuery DTO

The `where` clause is defined in the `where` key of the SearchQuery DTO:

```typescript
// SearchQuery
{
  labels: ['COMPANY'],       // Record labels to search
  where: { /* conditions */ },  // Filtering conditions (this is what we focus on)
  limit: 10,                 // Results limit
  skip: 0,                   // Results offset
  orderBy: { name: 'asc' },  // Sorting
  aggregate: { /* aggregations */ } // Aggregation definitions
}
```

## Basic Operators

RushDB provides various operators for different data types to create precise conditions for filtering records.

### Primitive Value Matching

The simplest form of filtering is direct equality matching:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: "John Doe",          // Exact string match
    isActive: true,            // Boolean match
    age: 30,                   // Number match
    created: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"  // ISO 8601 datetime match
  }
}
```

### String Operators

#### $contains

The `$contains` operator checks if a string field contains the specified substring.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: { $contains: "John" }  // Matches "John", "Johnny", "Johnson", etc.
  }
}
```

#### $startsWith

The `$startsWith` operator checks if a string field starts with the specified substring.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: { $startsWith: "J" }  // Matches "John", "Jane", "James", etc.
  }
}
```

#### $endsWith

The `$endsWith` operator checks if a string field ends with the specified substring.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: { $endsWith: "son" }  // Matches "Johnson", "Jackson", etc.
  }
}
```

#### $in

The `$in` operator checks if a string field matches any value in the specified array.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    status: { $in: ["active", "pending"] }  // Matches "active" or "pending"
  }
}
```

#### $nin

The `$nin` operator checks if a string field does not match any value in the specified array.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    status: { $nin: ["deleted", "archived"] }  // Matches anything except "deleted" or "archived"
  }
}
```

#### $ne

The `$ne` operator checks if a string field is not equal to the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    status: { $ne: "deleted" }  // Matches anything except "deleted"
  }
}
```

### Number Operators

#### $gt

The `$gt` (greater than) operator checks if a number field is greater than the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $gt: 18 }  // Matches age greater than 18
  }
}
```

#### $gte

The `$gte` (greater than or equal to) operator checks if a number field is greater than or equal to the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $gte: 21 }  // Matches age 21 or greater
  }
}
```

#### $lt

The `$lt` (less than) operator checks if a number field is less than the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $lt: 65 }  // Matches age less than 65
  }
}
```

#### $lte

The `$lte` (less than or equal to) operator checks if a number field is less than or equal to the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $lte: 64 }  // Matches age 64 or less
  }
}
```

#### $in

The `$in` operator checks if a number field matches any value in the specified array.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $in: [20, 30, 40] }  // Matches age 20, 30, or 40
  }
}
```

#### $nin

The `$nin` operator checks if a number field does not match any value in the specified array.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $nin: [20, 30, 40] }  // Matches any age except 20, 30, or 40
  }
}
```

#### $ne

The `$ne` operator checks if a number field is not equal to the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    age: { $ne: 18 }  // Matches any age except 18
  }
}
```

### Boolean Operators

#### Direct matching

```typescript
{
  where: {
    isActive: true  // Matches records where isActive is true
  }
}
```

#### $ne

The `$ne` operator checks if a boolean field is not equal to the specified value.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    isActive: { $ne: false }  // Matches records where isActive is not false (i.e., true or not set)
  }
}
```

### Datetime Operators

RushDB provides specialized operators for filtering records based on datetime values.

#### ISO 8601 string

You can match datetime values using ISO 8601 formatted strings:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"  // Exact datetime match
  }
}
```

#### Datetime object components

You can also match based on specific datetime components:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: {
      $year: 2023,
      $month: 1,
      $day: 1
    }  // Matches January 1, 2023 (any time)
  }
}
```

Available datetime components:
- `$year`: Match by year
- `$month`: Match by month (1-12)
- `$day`: Match by day of month (1-31)
- `$hour`: Match by hour (0-23)
- `$minute`: Match by minute (0-59)
- `$second`: Match by second (0-59)
- `$millisecond`: Match by millisecond
- `$microsecond`: Match by microsecond
- `$nanosecond`: Match by nanosecond

#### Comparison operators

Datetime values support comparison operators:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: { $gte: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z" }  // Matches dates on or after January 1, 2023
  }
}
```

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: {
      $gte: { $year: 2023, $month: 1, $day: 1 },
      $lt: { $year: 2024, $month: 1, $day: 1 }
    }  // Matches dates in the year 2023
  }
}
```

All number comparison operators (`$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$ne`) are supported for datetime values.

#### Array operators

You can also use array operators with datetime values:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: {
      $in: [
        "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "2023-02-01T00:00:00Z"
      ]
    }  // Matches either of these two specific dates
  }
}
```

```typescript
{
  where: {
    created: {
      $nin: [
        { $year: 2020, $month: 1, $day: 1 },
        { $year: 2021, $month: 1, $day: 1 }
      ]
    }  // Matches dates that are not January 1 of 2020 or 2021
  }
}
```

### Vector Operators

RushDB supports vector similarity searches through the `$vector` operator, which is useful for semantic searches, embeddings comparison, and machine learning applications.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    embedding: {
      $vector: {
        fn: "cosine",                     // Similarity function
        value: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],           // Query vector
        query: 0.75                       // Minimum similarity threshold
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Available similarity functions:
- `cosine`: Cosine similarity [-1,1]
- `euclidean`: Euclidean distance normalized to (0,1]
- `euclideanDistance`: Raw euclidean distance [0,âˆž)
- `jaccard`: Jaccard similarity [0,1]
- `overlap`: Overlap coefficient [0,1]
- `pearson`: Pearson correlation [-1,1]

The `query` parameter can be:
- A simple number (treated as `$gte` threshold)
- An object with comparison operators for more precise filtering:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    embedding: {
      $vector: {
        fn: "cosine",
        value: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        query: {
          $gte: 0.5,  // Similarity >= 0.5
          $lte: 0.8,  // Similarity <= 0.8
          $ne: 0.75   // Similarity != 0.75
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Logical Grouping Operators

When you need to create complex conditions, logical grouping operators allow you to combine multiple conditions.

### $and

The `$and` operator combines multiple conditions and returns records that match all the conditions. This is the default behavior when listing multiple conditions.

```typescript
// Explicit $and
{
  where: {
    $and: [
      { name: { $startsWith: "J" } },
      { age: { $gte: 21 } }
    ]
  }
}

// Implicit $and (equivalent to above)
{
  where: {
    name: { $startsWith: "J" },
    age: { $gte: 21 }
  }
}
```

### $or

The `$or` operator returns records that match at least one of the specified conditions.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $or: [
      { name: { $startsWith: "J" } },
      { age: { $gte: 21 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### $not

The `$not` operator inverts the specified condition, returning records that don't match it.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $not: {
      status: "deleted"
    }
  }
}
```

### $nor

The `$nor` operator returns records that don't match any of the specified conditions.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $nor: [
      { status: "deleted" },
      { status: "archived" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### $xor

The `$xor` operator (exclusive OR) returns records that match exactly one of the specified conditions.

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $xor: [
      { isPremium: true },
      { hasFreeTrialAccess: true }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Nested Logical Grouping

Logical operators can be nested to create complex conditions:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $or: [
      { status: "active" },
      {
        $and: [
          { status: "pending" },
          { createdAt: { $gte: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z" } }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Relationship Queries

One of the most powerful features of RushDB is its ability to query based on relationships between records.

> **Note:** The underlying mechanism in RushDB works as follows: when the SearchQuery parser encounters a nested object that is neither a flat object nor contains criteria operators (like $gt, $contains, etc.), it interprets this object as a related record reference, using the provided key as the desired label for the related record.

### Basic Relationship Queries

To filter records based on related records, use the label of the related record as a key:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: "Tech Corp",               // Property on the current record
    DEPARTMENT: {                    // Related record by label
      name: "Engineering",           // Property on the related record
      headcount: { $gte: 10 }        // Another property on the related record
    }
  }
}
```

This will find records named "Tech Corp" that are connected to at least one DEPARTMENT record named "Engineering" with a headcount of at least 10.

### Relationship Direction

You can specify the direction of the relationship using the `$relation` operator:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    POST: {
      $relation: {
        type: "AUTHORED",            // Relationship type
        direction: "in"              // Direction: "in" or "out"
      },
      title: { $contains: "Graph" }  // Property on the related record
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use a simplified syntax for specifying just the relationship type:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    POST: {
      $relation: "AUTHORED",         // Relationship type only
      title: { $contains: "Graph" }  // Property on the related record
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-Level Relationships

You can query through multiple levels of relationships:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    DEPARTMENT: {                    // First level relationship
      name: "Engineering",
      PROJECT: {                     // Second level relationship
        name: "Database",
        EMPLOYEE: {                  // Third level relationship
          role: "Developer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will find records connected to a DEPARTMENT named "Engineering" that has a PROJECT named "Database" with at least one EMPLOYEE with the role "Developer".

### Aliasing for Aggregations

When you need to reference related records in aggregations, use the `$alias` operator:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    DEPARTMENT: {
      $alias: "$department",         // Define alias for department records
      PROJECT: {
        $alias: "$project",          // Define alias for project records
        budget: { $gte: 10000 }
      }
    }
  },
  aggregate: {
    departmentCount: {
      fn: "count",
      alias: "$department"           // Use the alias in aggregation
    }
  }
}
```

> For more detailed information about aggregations, including available functions and advanced usage, see [Aggregations](./aggregations.md).

### ID Filtering

You can filter by record ID using the special `$id` operator:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $id: "123456",                   // Filter by ID of the current record
    DEPARTMENT: {
      $id: "789012"                  // Filter by ID of the related record
    }
  }
}
```

The `$id` operator supports all the string comparison operators:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $id: { $in: ["123456", "789012"] }
  }
}
```

## Logical Grouping with Relationships

You can combine logical operators with relationships to create powerful queries.

### $or with Relationships

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $or: [
      {
        DEPARTMENT: {
          name: "Engineering"
        }
      },
      {
        DEPARTMENT: {
          name: "Product"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will find records connected to either a DEPARTMENT named "Engineering" OR a DEPARTMENT named "Product".

### $and with Relationships

```typescript
{
  where: {
    $and: [
      {
        DEPARTMENT: {
          name: "Engineering"
        }
      },
      {
        PROJECT: {
          budget: { $gte: 10000 }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will find records connected to both a DEPARTMENT named "Engineering" AND a PROJECT with a budget of at least 10000.

### Mixed Logical Operations

You can combine different logical operators:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    name: "Tech Corp",               // Implicit $and
    $or: [
      {
        DEPARTMENT: {
          name: "Engineering"
        }
      },
      {
        DEPARTMENT: {
          name: "Product",
          $not: {
            PROJECT: {               // No projects that are "Canceled"
              status: "Canceled"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Nested Logical Operations within Relationships

You can use logical operators inside relationship queries:

```typescript
{
  where: {
    DEPARTMENT: {
      $or: [
        { name: "Engineering" },
        { name: "Product" }
      ],
      PROJECT: {
        $and: [
          { budget: { $gte: 10000 } },
          { status: { $ne: "Canceled" } }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    },
    AUTHOR: {
      $relation: "CREATED_BY",
      reputation: { $gte: 100 },
      POST: {
        $not: {
          status: "deleted"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query finds records created in 2023 by authors with a reputation of at least 100 who have at least one non-deleted post.
</details>

## Additional Notes

- Field names are case-sensitive.
- Missing fields are not included in the result. For example, searching for `{ active: true }` won't match records that don't have an `active` field.
- String comparison (`$contains`, `$startsWith`, `$endsWith`) is case-insensitive by default.
- When working with arrays in records, the conditions are satisfied if any element in the array matches. For example, `{ tags: "typescript" }` will match a record with `tags: ["javascript", "typescript", "react"]`.
- Logical operators can be used both at the root level and at any nested level, including inside relationship queries.
- Relationship queries are executed using `OPTIONAL MATCH` in Cypher, which means records will be included even if the related record doesn't exist unless you specifically filter for it.
