## Quick Example

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default>
  ```typescript
  import RushDB from '@rushdb/javascript-sdk';

  // Connect to RushDB
  const db = new RushDB("RUSHDB_API_TOKEN");

  // Push data with any structure you need
  await db.records.createMany({
    label: "PRODUCT",
    data: {

      manufacturer: {
        name: "ErgoDesigns",
        location: "Zurich"
      }
    }
  });

  // Query with precision - no query language to learn
  const results = await db.records.find({
    labels: ["PRODUCT"],
